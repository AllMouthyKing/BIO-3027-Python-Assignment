# BIO-3027-Python-Assignment
Assignment/Exam project for BIO-3027

This is the RNA-seq analysis pipeline carried out on frozen pancreatic/liver/skeletal tissue samples from Diversity Outbred mice.

The run code is in the Main.py:
Running it will open a basic GUI for choosing which dataset to analyse (pancreatic/liver/skeletal) before clicking the button to start the analysis

It should take 2-3 mins to complete due to delays introduced when requesting information from Entrez database to lessen traffic. 

Completion occurs when the results (3 text files & 2 png files are opened for viewing) 

The text files contain gene summary information while the two pngs are heatmap images of the genes. 

It is advised to let the program go to completion.
